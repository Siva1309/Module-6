## Operator Overloading

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to compute the product of two complex numbers by overloading the binary '+' operator using a class named complex.


### ALGORITHM

Define a Class:

Create a class named complex to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.

Constructor (__init__):

Initialize two instance variables, a for the real part and b for the imaginary part.

Overload the + Operator:

Define the __add__ method to overload the + operator.

Instead of addition, perform multiplication of the complex numbers using the formula:

(
𝑎
+
𝑏
𝑖
)
⋅
(
𝑐
+
𝑑
𝑖
)
=
(
𝑎
𝑐
−
𝑏
𝑑
)
+
(
𝑎
𝑑
+
𝑏
𝑐
)
𝑖
(a+bi)⋅(c+di)=(ac−bd)+(ad+bc)i
Create Objects:

Create two instances of the complex class with required real and imaginary parts.

Perform Operation:

Use the overloaded + operator to compute the product and display the result.

### PROGRAM

```
class complex:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b
     # adding two objects
    def __add__(self, other):
        return self.a * other.a, self.b * other.b
Ob1 = complex(1, 2)
Ob2 = complex(2, 3)
Ob3 = Ob1 + Ob2
print(Ob3)
```
