# Exp.No:28  
## Abstraction

---

### AIM  
To demonstrate the use of the ABC module in Python by creating an abstract base class Animal with a concrete method sleep() common to all child classes, and an abstract method sound() which is implemented differently in each subclass.

---

### ALGORITHM

Import Required Module:

Import ABC and abstractmethod from the abc module.

Define Abstract Base Class:

Create a class Animal which inherits from ABC.

Define an abstract method sound() using the @abstractmethod decorator.

Define a concrete method sleep() that prints a generic message, which will be inherited by all child classes.

Create Child Classes:

Define multiple child classes such as Cat, Snake, Dog, and Lion which inherit from Animal.

In each subclass, implement the sound() method with a message specific to that animal.

Demonstrate Functionality:

Call the sleep() method.

Create instances of the child classes.

Call the sound() method on each instance to display the unique behavior of each animal.

### PROGRAM

```
from abc import ABC,abstractmethod
 
class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass
    
 
class Snake(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("I can hiss")
 
class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("I can bark")
 
class Lion(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("I can roar")
       
class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("I can meow")
        
print("I am going to sleep in a while")
        
c = Cat()
c.sound()
s = Snake()
s.sound()

```
